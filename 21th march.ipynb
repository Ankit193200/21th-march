    "# Q1. What is the difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding? Provide an example of when you might choose one over the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding: Assigning a unique integer to each category based on its ordinal relationship. The order matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding: Assigning a unique integer to each category without considering any ordinal relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a variable \"Size\" with categories \"Small,\" \"Medium,\" and \"Large\":\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding: Assign 1, 2, and 3 based on the order (Small: 1, Medium: 2, Large: 3).\n",
    "Label Encoding: Assign any unique integers to each category without considering the order (e.g., Small: 2, Medium: 1, Large: 3).\n",
    "Choosing Between:\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose Ordinal Encoding when there is a clear order or hierarchy among categories.\n",
    "Choose Label Encoding when categories are nominal and have no inherent order.\n",
    "# Q2. Explain how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works and provide an example of when you might use it in a machine learning project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding: Assigning ranks to categories based on their mean or median of the target variable.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a binary classification project predicting customer churn:\n",
    "Calculate the mean target value for each category of a categorical variable.\n",
    "Assign ranks based on the mean values.\n",
    "Higher ranks for categories with a higher probability of the target.\n",
    "Use Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use it when there's a significant relationship between the categorical variable and the target, and you want to capture that in the encoding.\n",
    "# Q3. Define covariance and explain why it is important in statistical analysis. How is covariance calculated?\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance: A measure of how much two random variables change together. It indicates whether an increase in one variable corresponds to an increase or decrease in another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive covariance: Variables move in the same direction.\n",
    "Negative covariance: Variables move in opposite directions.\n",
    "Important for understanding relationships between variables.\n",

    "# Q4. For a dataset with the following categorical variables: Color (red, green, blue), Size (small, medium, large), and Material (wood, metal, plastic), perform label encoding using Python's scikit-learn library. Show your code and explain the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Sample data\n",
    "data = {'Color': ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'red'],\n",
    "        'Size': ['small', 'medium', 'large', 'medium'],\n",

    "print(df[['Color', 'Color_encoded', 'Size', 'Size_encoded', 'Material', 'Material_encoded']])\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The code uses LabelEncoder to encode categorical variables.\n",
    "Each unique category is assigned a unique integer.\n",
    "The output DataFrame shows the original categories and their corresponding encoded values.\n",
    "# Q5. Calculate the covariance matrix for the following variables in a dataset: Age, Income, and Education level. Interpret the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "Positive covariance between Age and Income suggests that, on average, as Age increases, Income tends to increase.\n",
    "The sign of covariance can indicate the direction of the relationship.\n",
    "Magnitude indicates the strength of the relationship, but it is not standardized.\n",
    "# Q6. You are working on a machine learning project with a dataset containing several categorical variables, including \"Gender\" (Male/Female), \"Education Level\" (High School/Bachelor's/Master's/PhD), and \"Employment Status\" (Unemployed/Part-Time/Full-Time). Which encoding method would you use for each variable, and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Encoding Choices:\n",
    "Gender (Binary): Use Label Encoding since there's no inherent order.\n",
    "Education Level (Ordinal): Use Ordinal Encoding based on the level of education.\n",
    "Employment Status (Nominal): Use One-Hot Encoding to avoid introducing a false order.\n",
    "# Q7. You are analyzing a dataset with two continuous variables, \"Temperature\" and \"Humidity\", and two categorical variables, \"Weather Condition\" (Sunny/Cloudy/Rainy) and \"Wind Direction\" (North/South/East/West). Calculate the covariance between each pair of variables and interpret the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature-Humidity: Positive covariance indicates that, on average, higher temperatures are associated with higher humidity.\n",
    "Temperature-Weather Condition: Limited interpretation due to mixed types.\n",
    "Temperature-Wind Direction: Limited interpretation due to mixed types.\n",
    "Humidity-Weather Condition: Limited interpretation due to mixed types.\n",
    "Humidity-Wind Direction: Limited interpretation due to mixed types.\n",
    "Weather Condition-Wind Direction: Limited interpretation due to mixed types.\n",
    "Note: Covariance interpretation is most meaningful between continuous variables. Mixed types may require additional analyses or encoding adjustments."
